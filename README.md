This is a collection of scripts and scripting libraries designed to work
with LANforge systems.

The LANforge/ directory holds the perl modules.

The lf_*.pl scripts are typically more complete and general purpose
scripts, though some are ancient and very specific.  In particular,
these scripts are more modern and may be a good place to start:
lf_portmod.pl lf_firemod.pl lf_icemod.pl lf_attenmod.pl.

This script shows how one might call these other scripts:
lf_wifi_rest_example.pl

For more information on scripting and LANforge, see this link:

Scripts will be kept backwards and forwards compatible with LANforge
releases as much as possible.

Code in this repository is released under the BSD license (see license.txt).

Please contact support@candelatech.com if you have any questions.

Thanks,
